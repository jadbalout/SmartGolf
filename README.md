# SmartGolf
**SmartGolf** is an alternate implementation of the Smart Rockets simulation using a genetic algorithm. 
The balls "evolve", using the genetic algorithm, to find the best path to its target hole. 
The Smart Rockets implementation is proposed by [Daniel Shiffman] in his book [The Nature of Code].
**SmartGolf** uses [p5.js] to render all the graphics.
