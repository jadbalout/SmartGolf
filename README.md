# SmartGolf
**SmartGolf** is an alternate implementation of the Smart Rockets simulation using a genetic algorithm.

The balls "evolve", using the genetic algorithm, to find the best path to its target hole. The Smart Rockets implementation is proposed by [Daniel Shiffman] in his book [The Nature of Code].

**SmartGolf** uses [p5.js] to render all the graphics.

To-do
------

* [ ] Reset Simulation.
* [ ] Maybe increase the fitness of the objects who took less fuel(frames) to complete.
* [ ] Redesign target and golf balls.
